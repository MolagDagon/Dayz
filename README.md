Folders and files for local servers with Expansion bundle mod.

My goal is to have folders and files with info and examples so a user can just copy and paste the templates.

This would include empty templates to fill in and templates already filled in that u can just copy and paste in the matching folder or file.

There will be a README in the folder with the json or xml files with further information.
