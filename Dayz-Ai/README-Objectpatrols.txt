Navigate to your AIPatrolSettings JSON file.

For me this is located here.
C:\\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer\mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\expansion\settings (Note: for some people config can be named profile instead)

Delete the "LoadBalancingCategories" parameter.
This means u delete all the parameters inside.
